# Food Service Industry (OOD in Java) <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90864900/152653951-5ba48dee-204c-4687-8725-8faf602494d4.png" height=50 width=50>
A Java project that models parts of the food service industry.
* We model places where customers can buy food: restaurants, food stands, and fast food.
* We model the payment of bills, including sales tax and tip. 
* We also model a tax collector who collects both sales tax and income tax. 
* We only model one year: the workers each have some income and pay tax for that year.
* We do not model many other things such as the food or menu.
